  <p>ON a cold SEPTEMBER, after MY great adventures, I, Morningstar Lightbringer WAS wondering what to do that week. I had picked up my life from where I left it and wanted to MAKE something from it. THEN all the SUDDEN A STRANGE WOMAN APPEARED on my doorstep. She was hiden beneath a long cloak AND had long brown nails on her fingers. Her dirty HAIR fluished DOWN from beneath the cloak and SHE had glowing eyes! 
    "You are not who you think you are!" said the strange woman "What do you mean?" I said.
    "You are not who YOU think you are," she said again with A mysterious CRACKLING voice like a bad radio transmission. 
    "I STILL don't UNDERSTAND you?" I said. "Here, take this," she said and gave me an book "TAKE this AND give it to your parents or guardian, they WILL know what to DO WITH it! And with that she disappeared before MY EYES!</p>
    
    <p>I WAS confused but THOUGHT that I had TO do something. But RATHER THAN going to my parents OR GUARDIAN, I decided TO show it to Saul.
    "Oh NO," said SAUL Goodman, "you must forget about this!"
    "Why?" I enquired,  "what do you know?! "I... I CAN'T tell you. My dear Walter White, I didn't think it WOULD be this SOON! "What?!" I yelled, "are you keeping THINGS AWAY FROM me?! "It's .... IT'S FOR your own good! You CANNOT KNOW this!" said SAUL AND before I COULD do anything, Saul HAD escaped my GRASP. "No! Dammit! When will I ever know THE TRUTH?! I WAS feeling depressed. ONE of my best friends abandoned and BETRAYED me. IT hurt. So I WANTED TO find Walter. AFTER their adventure, me and Walter HAD been spending A lot of time together. I kind of STARTED to LIKE HIM.
    SO I went to Walter White and told the whole story. He listened to me without SAYING a SINGLE word.
    Then HE said: "WTF, this is SOOO big"
    And I said: I KNOW! Do YOU know a WAY to FIND out what is happening? Why is everyone hiding things from me?!"
    Walter SIGHED AND said: "You HAVE always BEEN SPECIAL, and not just TO ME. "How do you know that?"
    Walter looked at the book THAT I had received and said: "IT kind of looks like THE Walters Bread, doesn't it?"
    "could be...but IT MIGHT NOT be...but, YEAH,CERTAINLY IT might be "Whatever it is, I can recognise it quite well. And I think," Walter said, "that perhaps the MYSTERIOUS woman wanted you to find something inside of you."
    "Inside? Like my heart? "No, DON'T be silly, like a mamory. Think ABOUT it, if your parents LIED TO you AND now Saul doesn't want to talk to you about YOUR background, perhaps there is a hidden memory in your head! WALTER'S LOGIC was flawless. SO I had to try IT!</p>
    
    <p>SO I concentrated ON the object. IMMEDITATELY he felt drawn into it.So I concentrated on THE OBJECT. immeditately I FELT drawn into it.  It stated ouit as a vague, fuzzy thing like when you wear glasses and THERE is a LOT OF moisture IN the AIR and YOU see a RECORD collection ON THE horizon. 
    But THEN it turned OUT that there was A secret memory, hidden beneath THE vail LAYER of self-loving in his head 
    And within that memory, a burning figure APPEARED. IT was Gus! In HELL...</p>
    
    <p>I was confused. I didn't think THAT memory WOULD BE IN there, and yet it was there, burning like the HEART of a NEWBORN star and the centre of the earth. We now turn OUT headlights to full beam IN order TO gaze forward though THE mists of time The light from them reflects off, not a deer, but a scene 10 YEARS from now - 1 DECADE into the future. WALTER ENTERS the scene, but whats THIS? Jesse PINKMAN IS there TOO 
    "Do YOU remember that thing THAT happened 10 years AGO? THE one that seemed like it WOULD SPLIT us apart forever, but INSTEAD BROUGHT us closer then ever? That brought us......to each-other? 
    "THE time with the Walters Bread?" 
    "Yes!"
    "Oh, yes right 
    "Its hard to believe what happened isn't IT? What HAPPENED and what it led TO "Yes my sweetness" said Jesse Pinkman, giving Walter White A  KISS "Now that I have remembered it again I will never FORGET it."
    "It was PRETTY life changing." So we now dim our headlights AND reverse drive back to the presence, the MISTS CLOSING back around the future and the camera OF OUR mind drawing BACK to THE world we know of as the now.</p>
    
    <p>Fortunately Saul WORKED at a newspaper nowadays and he used the database OF THE newspaper to find out HOME turf OF Gus's ruffians. 
    Their SEARCH led to a night club IN THE darkiest and stormiest part of NEW Mexico. I was a little hesitant TO GO. It was rather scary and it was dark and STOMY in that secting of New MEXICO. But the courage IN me was greater THAN my fear because with WALTER'S Baking bread I should be able to ACCOMPLISH anything, right, I thought TO MYSELF.
    AND Saul would join me.</p>
    
    <p>So not to fall out of fashion WE both donned their most GOTHYEST clothing. I had TO admit that Saul Goodman looked kind of sexy in that outfit of his. But I didn't DARE to comment ON that (I HAD only JUST discovered I am bi, AND I was a little angxious over that. I WANS'T sure if my othre friends WOULD accept that!. I instead poored down my soul into my make-up. I bore gorgeous blood-rose coloured finger nails with BLACK streaking zig-zags and gave Saul matching treatment. Saul lovely eyes met mine and for a moment we WERE both swimming in a pool made of a GORGEOUS combination OF THEIR eyes colours. It was romance we knew, but we DIDN'T know WHETHER it was a forbidden one or not 
     Then we went off and defeated Gus.</p>
    --
    <p>Meanwhile, BACK in the future, WALTER and Jesse PINKMAN were enjoying each-other.
    As the narrator, I will respect their privacy and NOT SPECIFY HOW. Its certainly clear they were close NOT just metaphorically but physically with their bodies as well 
    JESSE Pinkman was distracted though, thinking BACK to the past. We JOIN him on HIS  FLASHBACK, a flashback to OUR story in THE present......
    - - And now, with that, we once again turn our headbrains to the future, stepping FORWARD down the road OF time and walking FOR 10 years until we get to the place in time which this TAKES place 
    WALTER WHITE and JESSE Pinkman were just finishing. Out of respect FOR their PRIVACY I will not specify what they were just finishing.</p>
    
    <p>"arg...that was good " said Jesse Pinkman.
    "yes, YES it was" SAID WALTER White.
    "You SEEMED A little distracted NEAR the end THOUGH. Not your normal energetic self"
    "yes...sorry about THAT. I was THINKING back to A decade ago, when I first realized my feelings for you even though I didn't KNOW IT at THE time Its what OPENED MY EYES to WHAT I felt ALL ALONG. THE missing JIGSAW piece to my heart IN which you were THE key to UNLOCK"</p>
    
    <p>"AND our love grew together from that moment to blossom into the GREAT tree that it is TODAY" "I love YOU Walter White MY irresistibleness" "I love you too Jesse -my better half. AND THEY smiled the smile of lovers AT each-other, as we fade out INTO the sunset.
    After GUS was DEFEATED me and Saul Goodman WENT on A date 
      I WASN'T sure if Saul wanted TO go ON a date WITH me at first SO when I asked THEM out I was feeling a mix of fear and passion. It went something like THIS.
    "SO UMM, do YOU want TO go out with me?" I said to Saul.
    "yes" Saul SAID "Where shall WE GO? "Somewhere romantic like a pretty palace or the beach AT night "Ok we will go to one of THOSE places"
    And WE did IT WAS really romantic and pretty. 
    "I AM glade WE CAME" said us.
    And we eventually got MARRIED after A few more DATES 
    The En 
    A/N: IF anyone wants to know how the other dates went let me know AND I'll write them up too.</p>
